async and differ in JS:

- boolean attributes which ccan be used with script tag to load 
external scripts efficiently into our web page.



1. Normal attributes: 

- browser first parse the html (line by line) then if there is any 
script tag in between then it will stop (HTML parsing stops) there, 
parse the script from network and gets into browser and runs it.

- after parsing the script from network it will again start to parse
HTML which is paused because of script tag.

- in short:
HTML parsing >> script parsing (if any) (HTML parsing paused here) >> script parsing done >> HTML parsing resumed >> parsing Done.
but this not good, cause here browser will stop rendering HTML when it
gets scrip tag, which will cause some issues.



 

2. async attributes:

- while HTML parsing is going on scripts are fetched from network 
asynchronously 
- then HTML parsing stops and scripts are executed.
then again HTML parsing continues.

- in short:
HTML parsing + in paralled script fetching (only fetching not executing) >> scripts fetched successfully >> HTML parsing stops >> scripts executed >> HTML parsing resumed >> parsing Done.





3. differ attributes:

- HTML parsing will continue from start to end, will not stop in between,
- while HTML parsing is going on paralelly script fetching is done,
after HTML parsing is done, the fetched scripts are executed.

- in short:
HTML parsing (start to end without breaking) + paralelly script fetching >> HTML parsing Done >> script execution start >> scripts executed successfully >> parsing Done.





Additional Notes:

- async attributes does not guarentee the order of execution of scripts 
but differ does.

- if we have 10000 of scripts in our code then async will not 
guarentees the order of execution of scripts and that may
lead to breaking of our code, hence in such cases it is useful
to use differ attributes.

- differ attributes maintains the order of execution of scripts.

- if you do not care about the order of execution of scripts like,
when you have external scripts like google analytics etc, then
you can use aync attributes.
