bubbling, capturing, trickling in js:


<div id="grandParent"> // suppose it has onclickGrandParent() method
    <div id="parent">  //onclickParent()
        <div id="child">  //onclickChild()

        </div>
    </div>
</div>


event Bubbling:
  1. onclickChild() method will be called first
  2. then onclickGrandParent() method will be called
  3. then onclickGrandParent() method will be called

bubbles always come out 
from in to out



event capturing
it is opposite of bubbling
    1. onclickGrandParent() method will be called
    2. then onclickParent() method will be called
    3. and then onclickChild() method will be called

event capturing is also known as event trickling




we can use any event whether it is bubbling of capturing



in addEventListener method first parameter is always event and second is callback function
and third is useCapture which is boolean
addEventListener("click", () => {

}, useCapture)

here if useCapture is true then event will be capturing and if
we dont pass anything or false then event will be bubbling.


by default first event will tricked on and then bubble out
but if we want to control this then we can use useCapture to
specify any event
